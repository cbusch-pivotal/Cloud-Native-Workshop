= Lab 4 - Monitoring your Application

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, zero-downtime deploys, and managing application health very easy. In the this lab, you will continue to explore PCF application operations.

== Tailing Application Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.  Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult. Cloud Foundry's https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for aggregating logs.  Application developers need only log all messages to either `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for the application.  For this lab, use the Java sample workshop app.

----
$ cf logs workshop --recent

Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.

. To get a running _tail_ of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
$ cf logs workshop
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated. Press `Ctrl-C` to exit the `cf logs workshop` tailing of the logs.

=== For Operators (OPTIONAL)

Application operators will also enjoy commands like `cf logs`, but are often interested in long-term retention, indexing, and analysis of logs as well. Cloud Foundry currently only provides short-term retention of logs. To meet these needs, Cloud Foundry provides the ability to https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/log-management.html[drain logs to third-party providers.]

In this section, you will drain logs to a very simple provider called https://papertrailapp.com[Papertrail].

. Visit https://papertrailapp.com and create a free account.

. Login to your account and _Add your first system_:
+
image::papertrail_1.png[]

. Click on _Alternatives_:
+
image::papertrail_2.png[]

. Choose _I use Heroku_ and provide a name like "cloud-workshop-logs":
+
image::papertrail_3.png[]

. Note the URL + Port assigned to your application:
+
image::papertrail_4.png[]

. We'll use a Cloud Foundry http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html[user-provided service instance] to create the log drain for our application using the URL + Port provided by Papertrail:
+
----
$ cf cups workshop-logs -l syslog://logs2.papertrailapp.com:43882
Creating user provided service workshop-logs in org instructor-org / space development as instructor...
OK
----

. We bind that service instance into our application
+
----
$ cf bind-service workshop workshop-logs
Binding service workshop-logs to app workshop in org instructor-org / space development as instructor...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage workshop' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. We'll use a `cf restart` rather than `cf restage` to make the binding take effect:
+
----
$ cf restart workshop
----

. Navigate to the home Dashboard of the Papertrail app and select your 'system' to see log events immediately flowing to the log viewing page:
+
image::papertrail_5.png[]

You can see how to connect to other third-party log management systems in the https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html[Cloud Foundry documentation].

== Health Management

Cloud Foundry's http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/#hm9k[Heatlh Manager] actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.

. If you don't have one already running, start a log tail for `workshop`.  Alternatively, you could view the logs using the papertrail app.
+
----
$ cf logs workshop
----

. If you do not have more than one application instance running, execute the scale command to scale to 2 or more application instances.  Visit the application in the browser, and click on the _Kill_ button. This button will trigger a JVM exit with an error code (`System.exit(1)`), causing the Health Manager to observe an application instance crash:
+
image::lab.png[]

. After clicking the kill switch a couple of interesting things should happen.
First, you'll see an error code returned in the browser, as the request you submitted never returns a response:
+
image::lab1.png[]
+
Also, if you're paying attention to the log tail, you'll see some interesting log messages fly by:

== Viewing Application _Events_

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `workshop`:

<3> This `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> This `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
