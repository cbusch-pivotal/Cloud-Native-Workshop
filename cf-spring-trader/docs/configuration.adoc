= Configure the Config-Server

One of the benefits of Spring Cloud Services is the ability to configure a running microservice via a github repository. This can be useful especially in situations where localization is needed.

==== Set up the Git Repository

. For the repository, you can use https://github.com/jtgammon/trader-config-repo.git or fork it so you can make changes.


==== Configure the Config-Server

. Log into the console at https://console.run.pivotal.io or https://console.pcf1.fe.gopivotal.com, whichever is being used for this exercise.

. In your space, under services, select *Manage* under the *config-server*.

. Login, then select *Git*.

. Enter the repository https://github.com/jtgammon/trader-config-repo.git or your repo: https://github.com/<your-git-username>/trader-config-repo.git
